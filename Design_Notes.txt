Class BatchUnit will contain List of classes of Operation.
Each Operation class will contain a list of classes of Phase.
Each Phase class will contain a list of classes of Process

NOTE: ALL TRACK CHANGES MUST FIRST BE ACCEPTED BEFORE USING THIS TOOL!!!
NOTE: ALL CHARACTERISTICS TABLES MUST BE SELF CONTAINED. Meaning the
data for one script cannot be spread over separate tables.

High Level Process Flow

 1) Travers paragraphs of Header2 type until find one with text:
      Batch Area Characteristic Processing
    (Above string is user configurable.)
  
 2) Then process all tables until paragraph of Header1 type (or no 
    more tables) is found.
	
 3) Repeat process for SIM string;
       Batch Area Characteristic Processing for the Simulation Report
	   
 4) Then find first table after:
     Operation Report Layout
	 Simulation Report Layout
	 
 5) Process the tables of #4 for the Operations and Phases list and
    the proper order of them.
	
Maybe do #4 and 5 first?

  6) For all of above - create work sheets to contain the data
  
  
  
==============================

To find/copy the Script tables.
 1) find paragraph with Header2 style that begins the section of tables.
 2) traverse/copy nodes from there until one of following:
      - paragraph with Header2 or Header1 is found
	  - end of file found
	  
 3) Have routine that checks for all portions of table existing. For example
    some old docs SPLIT this table up! In this case an error should be displayed
	and the input document's table should be formatted properly.
	  
To find/copy the Layout table
 1) find paragraph with Header1 style that begins the section for this table.
 2) Have routine that inspects table for the row indicating it is truly the
    correct table. This row has all the column descriptors. If the table does
	not have this - it is just a description thing to skip over.
	
Processing the Layout table tree
 1) after check for extraneous precursor table (and skipping over it), process
    each row at a time.
 2) for each row cycle through the cells. First cell gets added to the Operations
    list. 2nd cell to the Phase and 3rd to the Process.
	
TODO: go through this description and ensure it represents my implementation.

Excel generation

Two functions for the "utility" stuff:
  1) Use Name (or number?) to retrieve the worksheet.
     - if doesn't exist, create new one with that name (or number?)
  2) Use row number and column number and cell text to update a cell
     on a provided sheet.
	 - if doesn't exist, create new one with those indexes
	 
Then have function that processes:
    AreaStructure
	Characteritics
	Calculations
	Calculation Variables
	
A Row has a RowValue (uint32)
A Cell has a CellReference which also uses the column.
So use their function but first check for row and cell.
If cell exists then remove it first.
